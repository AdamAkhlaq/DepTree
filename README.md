# 📊 DepTree

> **Visualize your software dependency trees with interactive graphs**

DepTree is a micro-SaaS tool that transforms package manager files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`) into beautiful, interactive dependency visualizations. Upload your dependency file and get an instant graph showing package relationships, sizes, versions, and vulnerability information.
